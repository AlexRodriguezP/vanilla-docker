# Make PhpStorm work with Xdebug

`Languages & Frameworks` > `PHP` > `Debug` > `DBGp Proxy`

- `IDE Key`: PHPSTORM
- `Host`: machinehost
- `Port`: 9000

You can now click on the `Start listening for PHP Debug connection` button in PhpStorm.
On the first run it will ask you to map your local directoryies to the docker directories, 
but after that nothing will be required anymore.

Have fun!
